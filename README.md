🌐 Cyber Ranger Internship: Hands-On Azure Security Experience

 [Josh Makador's Cyber Range Internship](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshmadakor/)  provided me hands-on experience, where I worked with key Microsoft Azure security tools including:

Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Azure Sentinel
Tenable Nessus

🔍 What I Learned:

Analyzing and interpreting security logs

Writing and executing KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries

Isolating virtual machines for containment

Disabling firewalls in controlled environments for testing

Conducting threat hunting exercises in a cloud-based lab

This internship deepened my practical understanding of cloud security operations and enhanced my ability to detect, investigate, and respond to threats using industry-standard tools.
