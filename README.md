üåê Cyber Ranger Internship: Hands-On Azure Security Experience

 [Josh Makador's Cyber Range Internship](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshmadakor/)  

The Cyber Range is more than just a training platform. It's a supportive community where we collaborate, ask questions, celebrate wins like job offers, and stay informed on real-world cyber incidents affecting the range.

- The classroom served as the central hub for all coursework, each section designed like a different mission. Through hands-on labs and real-world scenarios, I explored core security fundamentals and discovered how they‚Äôre applied in live environment.

- Having access to Microsoft Azure enabled me to build virtual machines, interpret security logs, and deepen my practical knowledge of cloud security by working directly with tools like Microsoft Defender and Sentinel.

- With full access to Tenable Nessus, I learned to run authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans, and performed compliance assessments aligned with DISA STIG standards to identify misconfigurations and security gaps.

üîç What I Learned:

Analyzing and interpreting security logs

Writing and executing KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries

Isolating virtual machines for containment

Disabling firewalls in controlled environments for testing

Conducting threat hunting exercises in a cloud-based lab

This internship deepened my practical understanding of cloud security operations and enhanced my ability to detect, investigate, and respond to threats using industry-standard tools.
