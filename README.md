🔍 What I Learned:

Analyzing and interpreting security logs

Writing and executing KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries

Isolating virtual machines for containment

Disabling firewalls in controlled environments for testing

Conducting threat hunting exercises in a cloud-based lab

This internship deepened my practical understanding of cloud security operations and enhanced my ability to detect, investigate, and respond to threats using industry-standard tools.
